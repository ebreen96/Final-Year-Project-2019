# Final-Year-Project-2019
This is my final year project 2019 while I attended University College Dublin. The project is called Data Science in Practice: An analysis of Jupyter Notebooks.
Notebooks to be viewed beginning with Prep_100 followed by Analysis_100 then Results_100. After notebooks numbered 100, then move to 200 and so on. 
There seems to be issue with loading the notebook on GitHub so to display the notebook go to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and copy and paste the link of the notebook.
